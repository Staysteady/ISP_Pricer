# InkStitchPress Pricer - Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Ready for Deployment!

Your application has been enhanced and is now completely self-contained with all product data included. Here's how to deploy it to Streamlit Cloud.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub repository: `https://github.com/Staysteady/ISP_Pricer.git`
- All changes committed and pushed âœ…
- Self-contained product data included âœ…

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Access Streamlit Cloud
- Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
- Sign in with your GitHub account

### 2. Create New App
- Click "New app" 
- Select your repository: `Staysteady/ISP_Pricer`
- Set main file path: `app.py`
- Set branch: `main`

### 3. Configure App Settings
- App name: `inkstitchpress-pricer` (or your preferred name)
- App URL will be: `https://inkstitchpress-pricer.streamlit.app`

### 4. Add Secrets Configuration (Optional)
In the Streamlit Cloud dashboard, go to your app settings and add these secrets (only if you want email functionality):

```toml
# Environment flag (for self-contained app)
DEPLOYED = true

# Email configuration (optional - only needed for quote sending via email)
# EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
# EMAIL_PORT = 587
# EMAIL_USERNAME = "your-email@gmail.com"
# EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your-app-password"
# EMAIL_FROM = "InkStitchPress <your-email@gmail.com>"
```

**Note: The app now works completely without any secrets! The above is only needed for email functionality.**

### 5. Deploy
- Click "Deploy"
- Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
